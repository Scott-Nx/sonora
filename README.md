- Gapless playback

- Romanization
- Cross-platform support
- Custom themes

## Install

### macOS

Install with [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install --cask nolight132/tap/sonora
```

After installing (thanks Apple):

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sonora.app
```

### Linux

#### Arch

Install from the AUR with your AUR helper of choice:

```sh
yay -S sonora-bin
```

`sonora-bin` installs the prebuilt release binary. `sonora` builds the same version from source
instead, which takes a while on a Rust and GPUI tree but links against your own system libraries:

```sh
yay -S sonora
```

#### Other

Flatpak coming soon.

### Nix

Just use the flake in the project root:

```sh
inputs.sonora.packages.${system}.default
```

The flake installs the latest tagged release binary.

### Windows

#### Installer

Download and run the [installer](https://github.com/nolight132/sonora/releases/latest/download/Sonora-Setup.exe).

#### Portable

Download the latest `windows-msvc.exe` for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/nolight132/sonora/releases/latest).

## Translations

Sonora ships these locales. Anything a locale is missing falls back to English at runtime, so a
partial translation is welcome — pick a language below and fill in what it lacks. Strings live in
`assets/i18n/<locale>/main.ftl`; `en-US` is the source of truth.

<!-- i18n:start -->

| Language          | Translated | Coverage |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| English (`en-US`) | 496/496    | 100%     |
| Deutsch (`de`)    | 475/496    | 96%      |
| Français (`fr`)   | 475/496    | 96%      |
| Русский (`ru`)    | 475/496    | 96%      |
| Українська (`uk`) | 475/496    | 96%      |
| Polski (`pl`)     | 475/496    | 96%      |

<!-- i18n:end -->

To add a language, create `assets/i18n/<locale>/main.ftl` and register it in
`crates/i18n/src/language.rs`. Regenerate the table with `scripts/i18n-coverage.py`.

## AI policy

We have nothing against the usage of LLMs in the project — in fact, we use them ourselves.
We believe that AI can speed up development in a lot of meaningful ways and be a useful
tool for learning new concepts. We have also found it particularly helpful for
contributing to substantial codebases such as GPUI and librespot, where it has helped
us quickly locate the relevant parts of the code.

**However**, using AI cannot act as an excuse for failing to
understand, review, and test the changes proposed. Furthermore, we expect communication
with a real person, not a computer. This includes but is not limited to PR/issue text
generation, comments in discussions, etc. A summary of changes can be generated
and does not need to be disclosed explicitly, but the reasoning and motivation
behind a change must come from the contributor and reflect their own understanding.

AI-assisted proofreading and translation of human-written text are permitted.

## Credits

Sonora is built with the help of some incredible open-source projects, including:

- [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) — a wonderful editor (~~ab~~)used by all core team members. Conveniently provides `gpui` — their native Rust rendering stack.
- [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) — Spotify playback and library integration.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) — certain YouTube ideas implemented in [ytmusic-rs](https://github.com/nolight132/ytmusic-rs). :)
